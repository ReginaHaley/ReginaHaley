Currently enrolled in the **OpenClassrooms Data Analyst apprenticeship track**, I'm building a portfolio of real-world projects to demonstrate my skills and commitment to learning. My goal is to grow into a full-time analytics role and eventually work with **AI and machine learning**.

## ✨ Fun Fact

Before transitioning into tech, I ran a successful home-based reptile breeding business (🐍🦎) and worked in political communications. I bring that same attention to detail, adaptability, and strong communication to every data project I take on. Outside of work, I’m passionate about dog training and not just basic obedience, but competitive dog sport. It requires an advanced level of precision, self-discipline, and teamwork with a partner who doesn’t speak your language. The process teaches me to celebrate progress, stay grounded through challenges, and stay focused on long-term goals.
