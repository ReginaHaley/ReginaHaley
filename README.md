## Career Changer and barrier buster.  In technology, there are no real limitations...only challenges waiting for solutions.

# 👋 Hi, I'm Regina Haley

I’m a passionate and determined professional transitioning into the fields of **data analytics and software development**.. a move inspired by curiosity and now driven by purpose.  

I’ve always loved solving puzzles and finding hidden patterns. My favorite board game growing up was *Clue* and I dreamed of being a detective.. piecing together clues to solve mysteries. When I discovered data analytics, it clicked: I could channel that same curiosity and problem-solving into something real and impactful.  

As I’ve grown in analytics, I’ve also challenged myself to step into **software development**, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python to understand how data connects to applications and how tools come together in a bigger system. Combining analytics with development gives me both the detective’s eye for insight and the builder’s mindset for creating solutions.  

To deepen my skills, I am now enrolled in an **AAS in AI Software Engineering** program. This formal training will strengthen my foundations in software engineering and AI while complementing the analytics and web skills I already practice. For an employer, it means you’re hiring someone who not only has hands-on project experience but is also steadily building advanced, in-demand skills that will grow with your team’s needs.  

This portfolio represents my journey: not just learning technologies one by one, but seeing how they fit together and proving to myself that I can keep pushing past challenges to create meaningful projects.

## 💬 A Little More About Me
I’ve worked remotely for years in both support and operations — tracking performance, keeping things organized and communicating clearly with customers and teammates. I’ve also run my own business, worked in politics and supported campaigns. These experiences taught me how to problem-solve, manage details and collaborate effectively.  

Today, I’m fully committed to building a career that combines **data analytics and software development**. I’ve completed multiple projects, I’m actively learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, and I recently enrolled in an **AAS in AI Software Engineering** program to strengthen my long-term foundations.  

I’m not just changing careers, I’m answering a calling. This path means everything to me and I’m prepared to work relentlessly, keep learning and do whatever it takes to earn opportunities, grow under mentorship and succeed in a field that truly excites me.
