# 👋 Hi, I'm Regina Haley

I'm a passionate and determined professional transitioning into the field of **data analytics** — a move inspired by curiosity and now driven by purpose.

I’ve always loved solving puzzles and finding hidden patterns. My favorite board game growing up was Clue and I dreamed of being a detective, the kind that pieces together clues to solve mysteries. When I found data analytics, it clicked, it gave me a way to channel that curiosity and problem-solving into something real and impactful. It feels like solving a puzzle with purpose, and I knew right away this was the career for me.

## 🎯 My Goal

I’m currently seeking a **data analyst apprenticeship** or **entry-level analyst role**, especially one where I can:
- Learn under mentorship while applying real skills
- Work with structured and messy datasets
- Communicate insights clearly and meaningfully
- Grow into a long-term career doing work I truly care about

### 🌱 Growth Mindset & Mentorship
I’m actively seeking mentorship and take great pride in being both teachable and adaptable. I deeply respect those with more experience and am always eager to learn from their insights, guidance and constructive feedback.

## 💬 A Little More About Me

I’ve worked remotely for years in both support and operations such as tracking performance, keeping things organized and communicating clearly with customers and teammates. I’ve run my own business, worked in politics and supported campaigns. But now, I’m fully committed to data analytics.

I’m not just changing careers, I’m answering a calling. This path means everything to me and I’m prepared to work relentlessly, keep learning and do whatever is required to earn this opportunity and succeed.
